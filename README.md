# PPS Easy

[![CI](https://github.com/abarghoud/pps-easy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abarghoud/pps-easy/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Overview

This is an open-source project that allows users to quickly complete the PPS (Parcours de PrÃ©vention SantÃ©) journey in France by simulating the required steps. It interacts with PPS APIs to optimize the process, enabling faster access to the PPS certification.

## Features

- **Quick PPS Completion**: Simulates the process, allowing users to obtain their PPS certification rapidly (3 seconds).
- **Data safe**: Your data is just transferred to https://pps.athle.fr/, and the result is sent back to your provided email

### Certificate Generation Form

![Certificate generation form](readme-assets/img_1.png)

The certificate generation form is accessible after logging in or as a guest. This form allows users to enter the necessary information (date of birth, event date, email, first name, last name, and gender) to generate the PPS certificate ðŸª„.

### Home Page with Login/Registration

![Login page](readme-assets/img.png)

The frontend application provides a home page with the following options:
- **Sign In with Username and Password**
- **Sign In with Google**
- **Access as Guest** to generate a certificate without creating an account.

**Planned Features:** In future updates, users will be able to **save their data** to avoid re-entering it each time they use PPS Easy. Additionally, an option will be added to **automatically generate the certificate every three** months, ensuring users always have an up-to-date certification without manual input.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abarghoud/pps-easy.git
   cd pps-easy
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up the environment:

   - Create a `.env` file at client and api projects root and set `ENVIRONMENT=local` to mock third-party services in local mode.

4. Run the backend:

   ```bash
   yarn nx serve api
   ```

5. Run the frontend:

   ```bash
   yarn nx serve client
   ```

## Usage

### API

You can use the following `curl` command to simulate the PPS journey:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/api/pps/generate' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "birthday": "1990-01-01",
    "event_date": "2024-12-25",
    "email": "example@example.com",
    "firstname": "John",
    "gender": "male",
    "lastname": "DOE",
    "recaptchaToken": "your-recaptcha-token"
}'
```

Replace the placeholder data with your personal information to simulate your PPS journey.

- If `ENVIRONMENT=local` is set in both the frontend and backend projects, recaptchaToken can be any non-empty string.
- Otherwise, recaptchaToken must be a valid Google reCAPTCHA token.


**_Please note the race date should be within 3 months_**


### User Interface

Access the application by visiting `http://localhost:4200` (or the configured port) to interact with the frontend. You can choose to log in, register, or generate a certificate as a guest.
